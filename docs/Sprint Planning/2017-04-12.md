# Sprint #2:

## Demo:
- css animations + `now` functionality
- basic event api + node localhost
- auth tokens

## General:
#### 1. Frameworks?:

> Using react components for better modularity.  Will lead to less client rendering

#### 2. Ops and deployment:

> Git hooks to auto deploy to server when pushing to master.  Use dev branches for normal work.

## Review:
#### +

> Whenever Guy pushes, you know it came from an incredible terminal

#### -
> This sprint was really short

> No Ben contact

> We have no E2E functionality as of yet
