# Sprint #5:

## Demo:
- Continuous Deployment (Release -> web)
- Front end build on SASS and TS (Now includes `<Nav/ >`)

## General:
#### 1. Typescript - Code reviews and style:
> Guy proof-read OverHearDesign master models (imgs missing)

> Alex review `Slider.tsx` and `Nav.tsx` (branch then pr)

#### 2. Web Apps:
> Most of these features rely on android chrome, investigate full market

>  Much more control and performance native, GMaps may be so much more efficient

## Review:
#### +
> Incredible to have continuous deployment operational!

> Front end development is a lot safer with transpiling and abstraction.

#### -
> We miss you Ben :'(
