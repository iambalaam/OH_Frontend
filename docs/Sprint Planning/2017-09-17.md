# Sprint #12:

## Demo:
- Show Ben the overall progress since skype (2017-05-15)
- Redux is currently integrated. (Action design and what still needs to be done)

## General:
#### 0. Greetings!
> We haven't had all 3 of us together in a LONG time!  (And we're expecting to next sprint too)

#### 1. Zeplin:
> Move all UI designs to [Zeplin](zeplin.io) as this will really help out development.
> - I think it will also give us the chance to design a leaner experience
> - Looks way professional
> - Should get an exact pixel-perfect match on the website

#### 2. Review LaunchDoc:
> So far so good, but let's keep this an iterative process

#### 3. Mock User:
> [Guy]: I still want to challenge if we need this, but I don't mind if it helps the backend

## Review:
#### +
> Ben is here!

> Back end build progress is operational!

> Integrated with a new tool in .ts without too much pain

#### -
> Not a fully functioning redux project (yet)

#### Â»
> Again, being able to set time aside.
