# Sprint #4:

## Demo:
- We have a design document!  Will be referencing this for future UI

- We have a slow but fully functional version of the slider written in react

## General:
#### 1. What should react control?:
> As we are getting the client to load a framework, we should utilise it to its full potential
> We make the whole website with react
> (For forms, we can make them just html-stateful and as a single component)

#### 2. Possible fixes to framerate:
> Consider limiting incoming events (~debounce) this

#### 3. What is our MVP:
> In favour of culling features (let's make this LEAN)
> Maybe focus on only catering to end users (and remove venues for now

#### 4. Tech & Design Choices:
> Move JS to Typescript in front and back end

> Integrate with SASS to precompile css (to align with design doc)


## Review:
#### +
> Ben started doing things (and he secretly enjoyed it)

> Guy learnt to use react and it does all of his work for him

> Alex contemplated

#### -
> Ben is not 100% sure of what direction he needs to go in

> Guy spent a lot of time reading

> No time for Alex
