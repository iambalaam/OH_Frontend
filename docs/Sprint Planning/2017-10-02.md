# Sprint #13:

## Demo:
- Making calls to our api -> lots and lots of events
- Redux is now properly linked to front end rendering (signed in/out, menu button, api failure)
- Zeplin front-end designs
- Mock user endpoint (gets user details, also responds to un-ath'd)

## General:
#### 1. Google maps vs. Mapbox:
> Google maps js api may not be up to our standards, I propose Mapbox unless anyone has any other ideas.
Things to compare:
- Usage and pricing (Let's put some logging in place for quotas)
- Performance (and consider mobile) Vector vs raster maps
- In apps?
- Offline caching

#### 2. Routing:
> I don't properly understand how much of the routing is performed by our server, and how much is performed by the application.
- React app will need to view all query params and cookies.
- Server will have to render the `<head>` per page and SEO.
- You should be able to give a *'share'* link to all pages.

#### 3. Clustering:
> How on earth are we going to do this?
- Make 4 levels so serverside cluster, request <= zoom level, and cluster the clusters
- Pre-defined clusters (need to work out per zoom level - research this)
- Research clustering algorithms - what does this mean for client-side?

#### 4. Social Media:
> What do we do?
- Do this after a long review of identity, before 2nd mock

## Review:
> People had to rush, so ran out of time.
